                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>
                  Empowering an inclusive veterinary community starts long
                  before the first day of veterinary school. While enrollment to
                  veterinary schools has been climbing steadily over the past 30
                  years, racial diversity is still lacking. With 66% of students
                  deciding to pursue the veterinary profession before they reach
                  colleague, reaching diverse youth early is crucial. In
                  addition, veterinary school tuition in the U.S. has risen at a
                  faster pace than other graduate schools. Access to trained
                  veterinarians that can provide high quality veterinary care,
                  for both pet owners and livestock farmers, remains challenged
                  in areas of the world where pet ownership and modern livestock
                  farming are growing. The Zoetis Foundation works with partners
                  who provide scholarships, debt relief, and other initiatives
                  to drive a more inclusive veterinary community and broader
                  access to veterinary training.

                <h3>Well-being</h3>
                <p>
                  Working in the veterinary profession can be meaningful and
                  rewarding, full of both opportunities and challenges. However,
                  increased debt, among other factors, leads to mental health
                  challenges, including a higher risk of suicide among
                  veterinarians than many other professions. The Zoetis
                  Foundation’s focus on mental health emphasizes the importance
                  of veterinary well-being.

                <h3>Livelihoods</h3>
                <p>
                  Healthy livestock is critical to achieving food security,
                  particularly in regions with exceptionally high incidences of
                  livestock and human disease. In order to ensure rising food
                  and nutrient needs are met, livestock farming productivity
                  must be improved. The Zoetis Foundation funds
                  capacity-building initiatives and business planning programs
                  that help veterinary practices and farmers develop sustainable
                  businesses, protect family legacy, and thrive in an
                  increasingly consolidated industry.
